My User Interface is based on a Martian Greenhouse. It is a menu with 8 choices, each one draws different animations.

<h3>1.Tree </h3>

This function creates a fractal tree using recursion and polar coordinates. The function takes the x and y values from where we want to start our tree, the angle in which it is facing, the length of the branch, the color of our tree, the stroke weight and the number of branches. Every time the function loops, branches are created using recursion.

<h3>2. Graph</h3>

I have stored a .csv file that contains the year and growth of the plant. Using an ArrayList I stored the data and draw a graph in the middle of the screen.

<h3>3. Image</h3>

Crop an image and adjust it so that it fits in the center.


<h3>4. Sphere</h3>
Using sphere() and transforming the sketch to 3D we create a spehre that rotates around its X and Y axis.


<h3>5. Levels</h3>

3 rectangles are drawn, with 3 other "inside" them. the width and fill color of these ones are generated randomly to recreate a measuring system.

<h3>6. Time</h3>

Using second(), minute() and hour(), The program displays the current time with the format hh : mm : ss. There is an arc revolving around this "clock" and an array of 60 circles around it representing the seconds.

<h3>7. Radar</h3>

Creating a radar using recursion. 50 lines are drawn, each one with a darker color, they revolve around the center.

<h3>8. Exit</h3>

exit() function to end the sketch.
